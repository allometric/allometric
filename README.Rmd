`allometric` is an R package for predicting tree attributes with allometric 
models. Thousands of allometric models exist in the scientific and technical
forestry literature, and `allometric` is a platform for archiving and using this
vast array of models in a robust and structured format.

`allometric` not only enables the use of allometric models for analysis, it 
also provides a structured language for adding models to the package. If you
are interested in helping the developer in this process please refer to the 
[Installing a Model](https://brycefrank.com/allometric/articles/installing_a_model.html) vignette.

In total **`allometric` contains `r n_models` models across `r n_pubs` publications**, the following
table displays the number of models by continent and category:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(model_summ.fmt, format = "markdown")
```

 Refer to the [Reference](https://brycefrank.com/allometric/reference/index.html)
for a full list of publications disaggregated by allometric model type.

If you are interested in collaboration (adding models or working on the
package functions) please email me at bfrank70@gmail.com

## Installation

Currently `allometric` is only available on GitHub, and can be installed using
`devtools`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("brycefrank/allometric")
```

## Getting Started

Most users will only be interested in finding and using allometric equations in
their analysis. `allometric` allows rapid searching of currently installed
models.

Before beginning, make sure to install the models locally by running

```{r eval=F}
library(allometric)
install_models()
```

This compiles the allometric models, and enables their use. `install_models()`
only needs to be ran at installation or following any package updates. After
running this function, the models are available in the variable
`allometric_models`. Refer to the `?allometric_models` help for more
information.

```{r}
head(allometric_models)
```

**Finding and Selecting a Model**

`allometric_models` is a `tibble::tbl_df` dataframe. Each row represents one 
allometric model with various attributes. Some columns are `list` columns, which
are columns that contain lists with multiple values as their elements. One 
example of this is the `family_name` column, which contains the names of all
authors for the publication that contains the model. 

`list` columns enable rigorous searching of models covered in the
`?allometric_models` help page, but to get started we will use a helper
function called `unnest_models()` that will give us a clearer picture of the
available data.  Using the `cols` argument we can specify which columns we want
to unnest. In this case we will unnest the `family_name` column.

```{r}
unnested_models <- unnest_models(allometric_models, cols = "family_name")
unnested_models
```

Now, each row represents unique data combinations for each model, which can be
quickly filtered by most users using `dplyr::filter`. For example, to find a 
volume model for the genus Alnus that had `"Brackett"` as an author or co-author
we can use

```{r}
brackett_alnus_vol <- unnested_models %>%
  dplyr::filter(
    family_name == "Brackett", model_type == "stem volume",
    genus == "Alnus"
  )

brackett_alnus_vol
```

we can see that model `ef95c311` is a volume model written by Brackett for 
*Alnus rubra*. The model can be selected using the `id` field:

```{r}
brackett_alnus_mod <- brackett_alnus_vol %>% select_model("ef95c311")
```

or by using the row index

```{r eval=F}
brackett_alnus_mod <- brackett_alnus_vol %>% select_model(1)
```

**Determine Needed Information**

`brackett_alnus_mod` now represents an allometric model that can be used for 
prediction.

Using the standard output of `brackett_alnus_mod` we obtain a summary of the model form,
the response variable, the needed covariates and their units, a summary of
the model descriptors (i.e., what makes the model unique within the
publication), and estimates of the parameters.

```{r}
brackett_alnus_mod
```

We can see from the `Model Call` section that `brackett_alnus_mod` will require
two covariates called `dsob`, which refers to diameter outside bark at
breast height, and `hst`, the height of the main stem. 

**Predict Using the Selected Model**

Using the `predict()` method we can easily use the function as defined
by providing values of these two covariates.

```{r eval=T}
predict(brackett_alnus_mod, 12, 65)
```

or we can use the prediction function with a data frame of values

```{r}
my_trees <- data.frame(dias = c(12, 15, 20), heights = c(65, 75, 100))
predict(brackett_alnus_mod, my_trees$dias, my_trees$heights)
```

or even using the convenience of `dplyr`

```{r}
my_trees %>%
  mutate(vols = predict(brackett_alnus_mod, dias, heights))
```

## Next Steps

The following vignettes available on the [package website](https://brycefrank.com/allometric/index.html)
provide information to two primary audiences.

Users interested in finding models for analysis will find the following
documentation most useful:

- [Common Inventory Use Cases](https://brycefrank.com/allometric/articles/inventory_example.html)
- `?allometric_models`

Users interested in **contributing models** to the package will find these vignettes the most useful:

- [Installing a Model](https://brycefrank.com/allometric/articles/installing_a_model.html)
- [Describing a Model with Descriptors](https://brycefrank.com/allometric/articles/descriptors.html)
- [Variable Naming System](https://brycefrank.com/allometric/articles/variable_naming_system.html)
