title: "Installing a Model"
---

```{r include=F}
library(allometric)
```

Models can be installed by anyone provided they are comfortable writing R and
submitting `git` pull requests. The model installation process involves these
basic steps.

1. Fork and then clone the `allometric` git repository to your local enviroment.
2. Write a new file in the `inst/publications` directory that
    a. Establishes a citation for the originating publication of the model.
    b. Instantiates the model (usually a `ParametricModel` or
        `ModelSet`) with associated metadata and prediction function.
3. Add and commit the new file to the remote forked repository from (1)
4. Submit a pull request to `brycefrank/allometric` via GitHub.

After the completion of step 4, your pull request will be tested and reviewed
for completion, and will become part of the main package if it passes review.

This vignette will focus on the second step. Explanation of `git` pull requests
are beyond the scope of this vignette, but interested readers can learn using
[About Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
Interested readers should also contact Bryce Frank
(bfrank70@gmail.com), or open an issue on GitHub if they want their models 
added but do not want to learn `git`.

## Establishing a Publication

`allometric::Publication` is a class that represents a given scientific article,
report, or other technical document that contains allometric models. 

Citations are established using `RefManageR::BibEntry` which is an R 
representation of a BibTex citation. For example, the BibEntry for the following
publication

H. Temesgen, V. J. Monleon, and D. W. Hann. "Analysis and comparison of nonlinear tree height prediction strategies for Douglas-fir forests". In: _Canadian
Journal of Forest Research_ 38.3 (2008), pp. 553-565.

is

```{r}
paper_citation <- RefManageR::BibEntry(
    bibtype = 'article',
    key = 'temesgen_2008',
    title = 'Analysis and comparison of nonlinear tree height prediction
        strategies for Douglas-fir forests',
    author = 'Temesgen, Hailemariam and Monleon, Vicente J. and Hann, David W.',
    journal = 'Canadian Journal of Forest Research',
    year = 2008,
    volume = 38,
    number = 3,
    pages = '553-565',
    year = 2008
)
```

many different types of publications are available, called "entry types", and 
documentation for required fields are given
[here](https://www.bibtex.com/e/entry-types/). The function that creates a 
`Publication` requires two arguments, the citation itself and an optional list
of descriptors. The role of descriptors will become clear as we 
progress. For now, just know that `descriptors` is a named list of
attributes that apply to *all models* in the publication.

For example, all models in this publication are for 
Douglas-fir, and were developed using data in the United States and Oregon.
With this in mind, we establish the `Publication` object.

```{r}
temesgen_2008 <- Publication(
    citation = paper_citation,
    descriptors = list(
        country = 'US',
        region = "US-OR",
        family = 'Pinaceae',
        genus = 'Pseudotsuga',
        species = 'menziesii'
    )
)
```

`temesgen_2008` now represents a publication with citation information and 
metadata that describe aspects of the models inside. One problem, there are 
no models inside the publication yet, so we must add them.

## Adding a Single Model

Models can be added one at a time. Other convenient ways of adding models are
described in the next section, but let us start with just one model.

The publication we are using implements several *fixed effects models* that
predict the heights of trees using various covariates. One of the functions the
authors use is $h = 1.37 + b_0 * (1 - \exp(b_1 * d)^{b_2}$ where $h$ represents
height and $d$ represents the diameter outside bark. Note that the height is a 
function of the covariate $d$ and a finite set of parameters, $b_0$, $b_1$ and
$b_2$. This is a perfect candidate for the `FixedEffectsModel` class.

```{r}
temesgen_2008_model_one <- FixedEffectsModel(
  response_unit = list(
    hst = units::as_units('m')
  ),
  covariate_units = list(
    dsob = units::as_units('cm')
  ),
  parameters = list(
    beta_0 = 51.9954,
    beta_1 = -0.0208,
    beta_2 = 1.0182
  ),
  predict_fn = function(dsob) {
    1.37 + beta_0 * (1 - exp(beta_1 * dsob)^beta_2)
  }
)
```

We can see that three arguments are used, `response_unit`, `covariate_units`, 
`parameters` and `predict_fn`.

- `response_unit` - a named list containing one element, which is the name of
the response variable. In this case `hst` indicates the model is the **h**eight
of the **s**tem using the **t**otal height. The value of this element is 
established by providing the units using the `units` package. In this case, 
the units are defined as meters.
- `covariate_units` - a named list containing all covariates usied in the model.
In this case, only one covariate is used called `dsob` which stands for the 
**d**iameter of the **s**tem, **o**utside bark at **b**reast height. Again, the
units are defined, this time as centimeters.
- `parameters` - a named list containing the parameters and their estimates.
- `predict_fn` - this is the prediction function. Note that the body of the
function is written using the parameters and covariates, but the only argument
provided to the function is `dsob`, i.e., the one covariate the model uses. This
is for the author's convenience, and parameters are populated into the function
at a later phase, so they do not need to be defined as arguments to
`predict_fn`.

Finally, we add the model to the publication using `add_model`

```{r}
temesgen_2008 <- add_model(temesgen_2008, temesgen_2008_model_one)
```

## Adding a Model Set

A frequent pattern in allometric modeling papers are "model sets", these are
sets of allometric models that have the same response, covariate and functional 
structure, but are fit for several species, age classes, etc. For example, 
Brackett (1977) fit 24 cubic volume functions for different species
disaggregated by geographic region and species.

`ModelSet` is a class in `allometric` that efficiently deals with these types 
of model structures. For this example we use `FixedEffectsSet` which represents
a set of fixed effects models. Model sets allow the author to import a table
(e.g., a `.csv`) of model descriptions to quickly define large sets of
`ParametricModel`s.

For this task, consider the Brackett (1977) publication. We begin again 
defining the `Publication`.

```{r}
bracket_1977_citation <- RefManageR::BibEntry(
    bibtype = 'techreport',
    key = 'brackett_1977',
    title = 'Notes on tarif tree volume computation',
    author = 'Brackett, Michael',
    year = 1977,
    institution = 'State of Washington, Dept. of Natural Resources'
)

brackett_1977 <- Publication(
    citation = bracket_1977_citation,
    descriptors = list(
        country = "US",
        region = "US-WA"
    )
)
```

Here we can see the citation information and the shared descriptors. Note that
in this case, `descriptors` only contains `country` and `region`. This
is because each individual model in `brackett_1977` is not uniform with respect
to `species` as it was in `temsegen_2008`, so we will have to define those 
descriptors at the model-level.

Next, we load a data frame of model descriptions and examine it

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tibble)
```

```{r}
model_specifications <- tibble::as_tibble(load_parameter_frame("vsa_brackett_1977"))
head(model_specifications)
```

We can see that `model_specifications` contains a number of individual models
which are specified by column names referred to as `descriptors`. In this case,
`descriptors` includes family, genus, species, geographic_region and age_class.
The combination of these values uniquely identifies a model within this
publication. `family`, `genus` and `species` are part of a standard set of 
descriptors called ["search descriptors"](https://brycefrank.com/allometric/articles/descriptors.html),
which get propagated to the searching functions described in the README.
`geographic_region` and `age_class` are not search descriptors, but still help
to clarify the purpose of the model within the publication.

Next, we instantiate the `FixedEffectsSet`, which looks very similar to 
`FixedEffectsModelModel` used in the previous section. The arguments are the
same, but the implication is that `response unit`, `covariate units` and
`prediction_fn` all apply uniformly to the models in the set.

```{r}
brackett_1977_model_set <- FixedEffectsSet(
    response_unit = list(
        vsa = units::as_units('ft3')
    ),
    covariate_units = list(
        dsob = units::as_units('in'),
        hst  = units::as_units('ft')
    ),
    parameter_names = c('a', 'b', 'c'),
    predict_fn = function(dsob, hst) {
        10^a * dsob^b * hst^c
    },
    model_specifications = model_specifications
)
```

Finally, we add the model set to the publication using `add_set`

```{r}
brackett_1977 <- add_set(brackett_1977, brackett_1977_model_set)
```

Just like that, we have defined 24 individiual models for the Brackett (1977) 
publication for a wide variety of species and taxonomic groupings.
